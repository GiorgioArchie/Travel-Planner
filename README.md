The Travel Planner & Journal website helps travelers organize their trips and keep track of their experiences. Users can create detailed plans by adding destinations, activities, and schedules, making it easy to stay on top of their itinerary. The web app also allows travelers to save important details like hotel bookings, transportation, and places they want to visit, all in one place. For group trips, users can share their plans with friends, making coordination simpler. Whether planning a weekend getaway or a long vacation, this app helps travelers stay organized and make the most of their journey.
In addition to planning, the app also serves as a travel journal, where users can document their trips. They can write about their experiences, add photos, and save special memories as they go. The app also allows users to tag locations, making it easy to look back at past trips and remember details. A visual timeline and map feature help users see where they’ve been and relive their adventures. Whether someone wants to keep a private travel diary or share their journey with others, this app makes it simple to turn trips into lasting memories.

## 12. Use Case Diagram​
Create a high-level Use Case Diagram for your application. Your diagram must show at least 6 key features of your application.
This activity should help you identify the end users of the application and the ways they would interact with the system. You can reference the examples covered in class. This will also help you scope out the features of your application. You can refer to this page for more information on how to create a Use Case Diagram.
## 13. Wireframes​
You will create wireframes for each page of the application.
Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations of the user interface of your application. They are used to plan the layout of the application and to communicate the flow of the application to the team. You can use any tool of your choice to create the wireframes. Hand sketched wireframes are also acceptable. You can refer to this for more information on why and how to create wireframes.
